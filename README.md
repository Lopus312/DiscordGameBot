# DiscordGameBot
Multi-functional Discord bot for many things, I use him primarily to learn python and working with API's. But if you'd like any of the features separately feel free to download the source code

## Hosting by yourself

### Windows (tested)
to host bot on your computer/server you'll need python3 installed 

https://www.python.org/downloads/

then after system reboot you'll need to install Discord.py\n
`py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py`
after that you are ready to go!
open cmd in directory you have downloaded this bot and enter\n
`python3 DiscordBot2.py`
### Linux (tested)
install python3 (install process is different depending on your OS its version so use google)\n
`python3 -m pip install -U discord.py`
### Mac
install python3 from there https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/
run `python3 -m pip install -U discord.py`
