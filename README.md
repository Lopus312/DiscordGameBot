# DiscordGameBot
Multi-functional Discord bot for many things, I use him primarily to learn python and working with API's. But if you'd like any of the features separately or anything else, feel free to download the source code

## Hosting by yourself

### Windows (tested)
to host bot on your computer/server you'll need python3 installed 

https://www.python.org/downloads/

then after system reboot you'll need to install Discord.py

```py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py```

after that you are ready to go!
open cmd in directory you have downloaded this bot and enter

```python3 DiscordBot2.py```
### Linux (tested)
install python3 (install process is different depending on your OS its version so use google)

```python3 -m pip install -U discord.py```
### Mac
install python3 from there https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/

run ```python3 -m pip install -U discord.py```
